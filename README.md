#**House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on key features such as the size in square feet, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and other relevant housing details. By understanding the relationships between these factors and house prices, we aim to provide a reliable tool for estimating real estate value.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is USA_Housing.csv, which includes the following columns:
Avg. Area Income – Average income of residents in the area.
Avg. Area House Age – Average age of houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Rooms – Average number of rooms in the houses.
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms – Average number of bedrooms.
Area Population – Population of the area.
Price – Target variable; price of the house.
Address – Address of the house (not used in the model).
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of various socio-economic and physical factors that can influence house prices.

🧠 Project Overview
This project applies Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning technique, to analyze and predict housing prices. By training the model on the available dataset, we aim to understand how different variables affect pricing and use that insight for future predictions.

The model focuses on numeric predictors and excludes textual fields like the address. After training, model performance is assessed using common evaluation metrics, and the results help illustrate the predictive strength of the regression approach in real estate applications.
