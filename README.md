#House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a simple linear regression model. The model is trained on data that includes the square footage of the house, along with the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. These features are used to estimate the selling price of a house.

The goal is to understand how each of these factors influences the final price and to build a predictive model that can assist in real estate pricing decisions. The dataset used contains historical house listings with corresponding prices, and the model is evaluated using standard regression metrics.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in the housing market and offers insights into how linear regression can be used for price prediction tasks.
